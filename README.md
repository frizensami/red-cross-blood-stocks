# Red Cross Blood Stocks

This repository scrapes and stores the current blood stock levels on redcross.sg into `bloodstocks.json`

Disclaimer: This is an *unofficial* data source: I do not know for sure if these are the exact numbers, but I strongly believe that they are via some educated guesses. Regardless, this information comes without any warranty or guarantees of any sort.    

## Visualizing and more

This data is stored in the Flat Data format so that it can be easily visualized / analyzed over time.
